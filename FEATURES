 - Easily embeddable inside C programs.
 - Reverse polish notation (stack based).
 - Data types: scalars (numeric and string), external integers,
   reals and strings (from host C program), file descriptors,
   lists (of other types in the stack), arrays (of any other
   types, including arrays and hashes), hashes (of any other
   types, including arrays and hashes).
 - Rudimentary garbage collection.
 - Rich library to manipulate the stack, string management,
   sprintf and sscanf, boolean operations, basic math,
   list management (seeking, indexing, reversing, converting
   from/to scalars), array and hash manipulation.
 - Control structures: if, unless, ifelse, repeat, loop, for,
   while, switch, foreach, map...
 - File commands for line-buffered and block-buffered files.
